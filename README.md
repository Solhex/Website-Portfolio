# Just Another Tech Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio's source code!
It's mainly built in python using Flask as its backend 
framework, with other languages such as HTML and CSS for 
the frontend.

## Why Build it with Flask?
Because why not? I tend to find it funny using languages 
for functions not initially intended for.
Though, I also think it's a great opportunity to learn to 
deepen my knowledge of how I can interact, and work with the 
web in python.

## How to run the project
As of now, this project is not yet functional, but I'm working 
on it, however, the instructions for running it are as follows.

First off, you'll need to download all the requirements which 
can be done by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After that you can then run the program using:
```
python main.py
```
Though you may want to add the `-d` flag to enable debug mode.
