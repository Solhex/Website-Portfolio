# Just Another Tech Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio's source code! It's built with 
mostly python with Flask, with some HTML and CSS.

## Why Build it with Flask?
Because why not? I tend to find it funny using languages 
for functions not really intended for, and also I think 
it's a great opportunity to learn deepen my knowledge of 
how I can interact, and work with the web in python.

## How to run it?
Currently, you can't still need to get in working order first, 
however the instructions are as follows:

First off you'll need to download all the requirements which 
can be done by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can then run main.py to then host the site on your local 
machine.
