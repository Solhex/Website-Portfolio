# Just Another Tech Portfolio

---

Welcome to my portfolio's source code! It's built with 
mostly python through Flask with some HTML and CSS.

## Why Build it with Flask?
Because why not? I tend to find it funny using languages 
for functions not really intended for.

## How to run it?
First off you'll need to download all the reuqirements which 
can be done by running 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can then run main.py to then host the site on your local 
machine.
